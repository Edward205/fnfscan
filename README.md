# fnfscan
bot that plays fnf 

very simple python script that looks at the pixels where the arrows are (hard coded), when those pixels change color (also hard coded colors) the bot will press the respective arrow key.

# how to use
just run main.py and if it doesen't work adjust the coordinates in the code (i will make it easier to do this through a gui i promise)

# to do list:
- gui
- auto detect the arrows on screen
- ability to detect multiple arrows and press multiple keys at the same time
- ability to hold keys
